The Electra mobile wallet is an easy to use, lightweight wallet designed to store, send, and receive ECA coins. Through the use of this wallet, you are given the convenience of making payments quickly and easily at both online and traditional points of sale. As with the Electra desktop wallet, ECA transactions are instantaneous and confirmed within 64 seconds.

The ECA mobile wallet is highly protected through the use of the following security measures:
- pin code
- mnemonic phrase
- fingerprint recognition

This is a highly efficient wallet, that allows users to store only the blocks containing their transactions, without the need to store the entire blockchain on your device. This keeps the app fast, without filling your device's storage capacity.

### Security note: During initial setup users will be prompted to enable the phone's lock screen if not enabled already. In order to use the mobile wallet, it is mandatory this feature remains enabled.
